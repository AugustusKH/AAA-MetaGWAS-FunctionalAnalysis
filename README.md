# Functional Analysis Based on Genome-wide Association Study Meta-analysis in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm 

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains one of the most fatal non-communicable diseases worldwide, despite advances in surgical and therapeutic approaches. Genetics and molecular mechanisms are known to play crucial roles in the development and progression of various diseases, including infectious diseases, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Moreover, bioinformatics and omics technologies have become crucial components of biomedical science since the genomic and postgenomic eras. Therefore, we implemented integrative bioinformatics pipelines to identify melecular mechanisms insight AAA. First, we conducted a GWAS meta-analysis based on summary statistics of AAA obtained from the GWAS Catalog following this link (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).
